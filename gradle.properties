# This repo targets Java 21.
# Avoid pinning org.gradle.java.home to a machine-specific path, since it breaks CI and Docker builds.
# Use your local JAVA_HOME (or toolchains) instead.

# Supply-chain hardening: enforce Gradle dependency verification when `gradle/verification-metadata.xml` exists.
# Gradle's default is already strict when the file is present, but we set it explicitly for clarity.
