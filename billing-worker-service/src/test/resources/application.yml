# Test-scoped defaults for billing-worker-service.
#
# Several other service modules (tax-service, labor-service, etc.) are on the
# test classpath and include their own application.yml with defaults like
# server.port and spring.flyway.*. Those can leak into worker tests when Spring
# Boot loads config resources from the classpath.
#
# We keep worker tests isolated by disabling Flyway by default and using an
# ephemeral server port when a web server is started.
